## VirtueMe

My name is *{{ site.author.name }}*, I have been using different development tools for the last 20 years.

* C/C++ (Unix & Windows)
* Visual Basic 4.0
* ASP
* VB.net / C# from the beginning in 2001.
* Ruby
* Javascript (Vanilla)
* NodeJS
* Sql-server 2000-2012
* [RavenDB](http://ravendb.net/)
* MongoDB
* MSMQ
* [Castle Windsor](http://www.castleproject.org/projects/windsor/)
* [nHibernate](http://nhforge.org/)
* [nServiceBus](http://particular.net/NServiceBus)
* Git / SVN / TFS

I try to work in a clean environment and learn as much as I can to get the best out of the tools. 

I have built a large financial web-application that has been been used the last 11 years. I stopped working on it 3 years ago after migrating the last c++ code to c#. I left the code for the great employers at [Bouvet](http://www.bouvet.no) to evolve and maintain this huge application. The application is heavily influent by MSMQ and relies heavily on SQL. 

I'm very proud of mye wife [Shamuish](http://hobbyvimsen.blogspot.com). She has given me 2 beautiful kids. From a former marriage I have 2 boys.
